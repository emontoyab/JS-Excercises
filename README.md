# JS-Excercises

Here you find my first excercises in order to learn JavaScript

These excercises are based on a document listed here ([Javascript Challenges](https://github.com/emontoyab/JS-Excercises/blob/main/Javascript%20Challenges.pdf)) and are intended to learn and practice JS.

To execute each excercise and try its results, you should install node.js and run the next command:

```JS
                                        node NAME_OF_THE_FILE.js
```

For example, if you want to try the bmi calculator, you have to enter the next command:

```JS
                                        node 1-bmi-calculator.js
```
